A customization of the Ancient One's custom output *Character Sheet* for <a href="http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab">Hero Lab</a>  
  
It adds a new control panel section for quick navigation to specific sections within the character sheet.  
To see it in action, scroll to the bottom of this readme.
  
## To use:
1. Click the button for the section you'd like to see.  
2. The related section will scroll immediately into view and be briefly hightlighted.  

#### Use Notes   
* Highlighting is a a 3s pulse animation. It could use some section specific tweaking or a better form of highlighting.
* Navigating to *Spec Abilities* require the character sheet override *Show Feat/Ability Descriptions* to be enabled.  
   If the override is not enabled when *Spec Abilities* is selected the override will be automatically enabled then the section will be scrolled into view  	
 to be selected.  
A similar concern may also apply to Spells - *Spell navigation is barely tested*

## To install:
1. Navigate to where Hero Lab stores its custom output on your computer.
_Typically here:_ C:\ProgramData\Hero Lab\customoutput\pathfinder  
2. Create a new directory named: tdjr_rt_complete  
3. Copy the two files into the newly created directory.  
* output.xml
* tdjr_rt_complete.xsl
4. Open Hero Lab _(no need to reload Hero Lab if it is already running_  
5. Load your character/portfolio  
6. File | Save Custom Output | Tillman's ...
7. Enjoy easier navigation of Ancient One's excellent Character Sheet
